Interactive Firewall for Android 2.3+

On every first connection attempt of every App installed, this App will ask the
user whether to allow or block this specific connection or a set of connections
similar to the one seen.

It uses iptables to setup an effective network firewall and is relies on the 'su'
and 'iptables' binaries which are likely to be present on every rooted Android.
